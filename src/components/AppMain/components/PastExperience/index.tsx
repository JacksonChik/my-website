                    Full stack developer @ KM.ON by Karl Mayer

                    I worked here for 3 months(2021.06 - 2021.09) as an intern. Absolutely amazing workplace culture, the tech stack's
                    also cool as hell(My team used TypeScript w/ React.js + Scala w/ Play + Postgresql). Learnt a lot from my mentors
                    and made some good friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My other offer at that time was to work as an embedded SWE intern for ASM Pacific Technology LTD. But I don't regret
                    it one bit for choosing KM.ON.
